# Contributing to dlkp

We will be extremely happy to integrate your contributions to `dlkp`. Please follow the below process:

1. Check if there is already [an issue](https://github.com/midas-research/dlkp/issues) for your concern.
2. If there is not, open a new one to start a discussion.
3. If we decide your concern needs code changes, we would be happy to accept a pull request. Please consider the 
commit guidelines below.

## Git Commit Guidelines

If there is already a ticket, use this number at the start of your commit message. 
Use meaningful commit messages that described what you did.

**Example:** `GH-42': Added new keyphrase extraction algorithm as proposed in <paper name>` 


## Developing locally

For contributors looking to get deeper into the API we suggest cloning the repository and checking out the unit
tests for examples of how to call methods.

### setup

You can either use [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/) for this:

```bash
pipenv install --dev && pipenv shell
```

or create a python environment of your preference and run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### tests

To run all basic tests execute:
```bash
pytest
```

### code formatting

To ensure a standardized code style we use the formatter [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) and for standardizing imports we use [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).
If your code is not formatted properly, the tests will fail.

You can automatically format the code via `black --config pyproject.toml src/ && isort src/` in the src root folder.

### pre-commit hook

If you want to automatically format your code on every commit, you can use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
Just install it via `pip install pre-commit` and execute `pre-commit install` in the root folder.
This will add a hook to the repository, which reformats files on every commit.
